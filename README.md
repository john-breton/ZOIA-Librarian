# ZOIA Librarian

This repo represents a snapshot of the work completed during my first co-op term working for Empress Effects Inc.

This repo is not open to contributions and serves only as a reference.

The project remains in active development to this day, and the main repo can be found at the following link:

The project consisted of three phases. 

### Phase 1
The first phase involved the creation of extensive documentation. 
This documentation included a design document that utilized formal requirement specification alongside user stories to create a complete vision for a ZOIA Librarian. Following the completion of the design document, a testing plan and JSON schemas were created. Finally, a presentation was prepared to explore the pros and cons of various backend implementations for the ZOIA Librarian. 
This phase lasted approximately one month.

### Phase 2
The second phase dealt with the coding of the backend implementation for the ZOIA Librarian. 
Development was test-driven, which helped increase the speed at which features were implemented. The choice was made during Phase 1 that Python would be the main language for the application. As such, the majority of the project was written in Python.
All major backend functionality was completed in roughly three weeks. Many bugs were avoided due to the adherence to TDD, which helped to reduce the development time of Phase 3.
This phase lasted approximately one month.

### Phase 3
The third and final phase of development dealt with the creation of a frontend graphical user interface.
The interface was designed using Qt Designer. Frontend features were implemented using the PySide 2 module suite and Python. 
Phase 3 took a considerable amount of time to properly develop the features that were deemed necessary during Phase 1. 
The state of the current application has far surpassed these initial requirements. The application continues to evolve to user feedback to this day. 
This phase lasted approximately two months.

# ZOIA Librarian

This repo represents a snapshot of the work completed during my first co-op term working for Empress Effects Inc.

This repo is not open to contributions and serves only as a reference.

The project remains in active development to this day, and the main repo can be found at the following link:

The project consists of three phases. 

### Phase 1
The initial phase demanded for the creation of extensive documentation. 
This included a design document that utilizes formal requirement specification, alongside user stories in
order to create a complete vision for a ZOIA Librarian. Following the completion of this design document, 
a testing plan and JSON schemas were created, alongside a presentation exploring the pros and cons of
various backend implementations for the ZOIA Librarian. This phase lasted approximately 1 month.

### Phase 2
The second phase of the project was the coding of the backend implementation for the ZOIA Librarian. 
Development was test-driven, which increased the speed at which the backend was created. 
All major backend functionality was completed in roughly 3 weeks and due to the adherence to TDD, changes
to this functionality was rare throughout Phase 3.

### Phase 3
The third and final phase of development dealt with the creation of a frontend graphical user interface.
Using Qt Designer, the interface was designed, while implementation was coded using the PySide 2 module suite. 
This phase of development took a considerable amount of time in order to properly develop the features deemed necessary
during Phase 1. The state of the current application has far surpassed these initial requirements, and the application
continues to evolve to user feedback to this day. This phase lasted approximately 2 months.
